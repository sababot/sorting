<h1 align="center">Sorting</h1>
A list of the most popular sorting algorithms implemented in C++. This repo doesn't have much use but it really helps to understand the behind the scenes of many of these sorting algorithms which we use everyday.

<h1 align="center">Installation</h1>
The main script called ***sort.cpp*** which is a cli program to test all of the algorithms
Each folder contains ***'algorithm'.cpp*** and can be built using "g++ main.cpp -o 'algorithm'"

<h1 align="center">Compiling</h1>
Compiling the whole repo (no makefile sorry):

```g++ sort.cpp bubble/bubble.cpp comb/comb.cpp merge/merge.cpp radix/radix.cpp shell/shell.cpp bucket/bucket.cpp counting/counting.cpp insertion/insertion.cpp quick/quick.cpp selection/selection.cpp -o sort```
